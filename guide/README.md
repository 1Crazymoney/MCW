## Tools

If you use Visual Studio Code for editing the markdown files for this project, consider using the Paste Image VS Code extension to paste an image from the clipboard, which creates a markdown image tag and saves the image to a relative directory: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image

Once you’ve installed the extension, add the following user setting to VS Code to automatically save the images to the media folder relative to your article:
"pasteImage.path": "./media/”

If you want to specify the image name (use-kabob-case, don’t include file extension), simply type in the name, highlight it, then use the Ctrl+Alt+V (Mac: Cmd+Alt+V) command to have Paste Image do its magic.
