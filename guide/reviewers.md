# Guide to reviewing MCW package updates

There are two official types of maintenance schedules each of our packages undergo by our team of maintainers: test/fixes and updates. A test/fix happens more often and is a way to ensure minor changes to the Azure portal and its services are accounted for in the hands-on labs, and that any breaking changes are resolved for a smooth user experience. Updates, on the other hand, consist of significant changes to the whiteboard design documents, hands-on-labs, and associated preferred solutions. These involve [subject matter expert (SME) reviews](./reviewers.md) as part of the update process.

The instructions contained within this guide apply to both test/fixes and updates.
